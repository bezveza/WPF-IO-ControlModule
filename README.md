# Digital-Input-Control-Module

A simple simulator which can be used as a digital logic exerciser, I/O control sequencer, visual indicator for remote monitoring and a lot more.

Originally developed as Arduino logic simulator, it works as a client/server application using named pipes for interfacing.

The code behind can be easily modified to hook up a driver wrapper to control a real device, instrument or any gadget of your choice.
