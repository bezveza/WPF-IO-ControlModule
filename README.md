# Digital-Input-Module-Simulator
A simple digital input simulator which can be used for DAQ systems, I/O hardware control etc.
Originally I created it as Arduino logic simulator. It works as a client/server application with a separate control module.
The modules consist of input, output and control module. It is using named pipes for the modules to communicate with each other.
Initially it was just using random numbers to simulate an input sensor behavior but later planning to integrate an 
I/O board for fixture hardware control. The project is based on WPF using C#.

Please try playing with it, experiment and improve the code. Thanks.
