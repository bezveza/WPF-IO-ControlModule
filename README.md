The code behind is modular enough for additional external libraries to be added to control real devices such as wireless I/O modules, or machine/instruments for industrial applications. You can also easily customize or port it to other languages to interface with any gadgets from your personal projects.

You can start, control and close any processes in your computer using your mobile device.

Turning off manually one of the LED's/device modules will send a real-time notification to the web control interface. You can configure it and create any event you want to trigger a notification.  

You can use MySQL or MongoDB for event logging which can be viewed and downloaded from the web control interface.

This project is based on WPF using C#.
