# Digital-Input-Control-Module

A simple simulator which can be used as a logic exerciser, I/O control sequencer, visual indicator for remote monitoring, debug tool for test automation and others.

Originally developed as Arduino logic simulator, it works as a client/server application using named pipes for interfacing.

The code behind is modular enough for additional external libraries to control real devices, instruments or any gadgets from your personal projects.
